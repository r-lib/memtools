## Overview

memtools provides debugging tools to detect and solve memory leaks in R:

- Record __memory snapshots__ of the R heap.
- Compare snapshots to detect leaked objects with a large retained size.
- Inspect the __shortest paths__ between nodes (e.g. between a leaked node and its __dominator__).

See [`vignette("memtools")`](https://memtools.r-lib.org/articles/memtools.html) for a tutorial.
